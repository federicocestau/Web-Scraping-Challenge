# Web-Scraping-Challenge
In this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Pages used: 

https://mars.nasa.gov/news/

https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/

https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en

https://space-facts.com/mars/

https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars
